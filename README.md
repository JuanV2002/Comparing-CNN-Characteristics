# Comparing-CNN-Characteristics


Different characteristics of CNN Architecture were manipulated to evaluate accuracy scores on how well the CNN architect was performing on class classification of images from CIFAR10. Some characteristics include the amount of layers, pooling type [average and max] and different activation functions [Relu, LeakyRelu, Tahn, and ElU]. The optimization was done by Adam or SDG while optimizing each architecture to compare how each performs. After the dropout and batching normalization were added to the worst performing model, based on the performance on the activation function accuracy average.
